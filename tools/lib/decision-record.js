/**
 * The decision-record marker (#121) — makes recording an answer to a blocking question a
 * POSITIVE, machine-readable act, never just the absence of `needs-decision`
 * (tools/lib/labels.js, NEEDS_DECISION_LABEL).
 *
 * WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS. #122 consolidated the design-approval gate into the wider
 * `needs-decision` (CONVENTIONS.md §5, *Decision gate*) — a human must answer a blocking
 * question before an issue can start. #121 answers a narrower but sharper question: what
 * does ANSWERING look like, mechanically? "Clear the label" was the obvious answer and the
 * wrong one — #127 measured it failing LIVE: a ruling was posted as ordinary prose in a
 * comment, the gate label was removed, and a later triage pass, reading the issue fresh, saw
 * no machine-readable record of a decision and RE-GATED it. The ruling had been sitting in a
 * comment the whole time. A cleared label is indistinguishable from a label never applied.
 *
 * So the fix makes the ANSWER the artifact a consumer reads, not the absence of a gate — the
 * same principle CONVENTIONS.md already applies to a design conclusion's three units ("prose
 * does not block, so prose is not the record"), extended from the QUESTION side to the
 * ANSWER side.
 *
 * TWO MARKERS, TWO DIFFERENT JOBS — read together, never one alone (identical shape to
 * tools/lib/migration-grant.js, which this module is modelled on):
 *   - a LABEL (`decision-recorded`, tools/lib/labels.js) — makes a recorded decision a cheap
 *     `gh issue list --label` query, and — the load-bearing half — applying a label on GitHub
 *     requires triage/write permission, so a drive-by comment on this public repo cannot
 *     manufacture a decision merely by posting well-formed text.
 *   - a COMMENT (this module's DECISION_MARK/REOPEN_MARK) — carries what a label cannot: WHO
 *     ruled (never the typist — mirrors `Filed-by:`, CONVENTIONS.md §5 *Provenance*), WHAT
 *     `<!-- decision:options -->` block (if any) it answers, and WHEN. The comment is the
 *     authority; the label is the gate.
 *
 * Both are required for a decision to read as live (evaluateIssue, below) — a label with no
 * live comment is exactly the state a rolled-back/failed write leaves, and must refuse, not
 * "recorded".
 *
 * PURE BY CONSTRUCTION, same posture as migration-grant.js / readiness.js / landed.js /
 * shipguard.js: signals in, verdict out. No git, no network, no `gh`.
 *
 * WHO IS ALLOWED TO WRITE THE COMMENT is a DIFFERENT question from who is allowed to APPLY
 * the label, and this module answers only the second by requiring TRUSTED_ASSOCIATIONS on
 * read — the same hole migration-grant.js closes, for the same public-repo reason. Unlike
 * `colab migration-grant` / `colab ci-grant` / `colab promote`, `colab decision --record` is
 * deliberately NOT gated on COLAB_HUMAN=1: those three AUTHORIZE a write to production or
 * trunk that did not exist before the command ran; this one TRANSCRIBES a call a human
 * already made elsewhere (the ordinary case is `Filed-by: boss` — an agent recording Boss's
 * ruling, not inventing one). The safety property is carried by requiring `ruledBy` (no
 * default) plus TRUSTED_ASSOCIATIONS on read, not by gating who may type the command. If that
 * is judged too weak in review, requiring COLAB_HUMAN=1 here too is the safe direction and
 * costs one line in tools/colab — flagged, not decided, by this module.
