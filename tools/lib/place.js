/**
 * Place-claims (CONVENTIONS.md, "Place-claims") — the writer-verifiable hold `writes: serial`
 * needs and `isolated` does not (#136).
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT. Three partial mechanisms already exist in this fleet and none is a
 * place-claim: the claim registry (lib/state.js `claims`) holds an ISSUE, not a PLACE; a
 * worktree's existence implies nothing about who is writing to it right now (creating one is
 * taking it — there is no separate act); and a session dashboard's own spawn-time trunk-lock is
 * keyed to spawning a ship/sweep-kind session, which cannot answer "may I write here right now"
 * for work that never came through a spawn (an implementer agent fanned out by a coordinator,
 * for instance). This module is that missing, general primitive.
 *
 * RELEASE IS A LIVENESS LOOKUP AT READ TIME, NEVER A STATE TRANSITION WRITTEN AT KILL TIME.
 * "Dies with its session" is what a reader assumes and is not what a stored flag can promise —
 * nothing reliable runs at the moment a session dies. Measured on the one such lock already
 * running in this fleet (the dashboard's spawn-time trunk-lock): it releases only once a poller
 * NOTICES the holder died, roughly a minute later, so a caller that kills a session and
 * immediately retries gets a refusal indistinguishable from a genuine conflict. This module does
 * not write a `released` flag at all — `isLive`/`holderOf`/`conflict` re-derive liveness on every
 * call, so a dead holder's record disappears from a caller's point of view the instant it is next
 * read, with no lag and no poller.
 *
 * MACHINE-LOCAL ONLY, DELIBERATELY (#128 §10 Q3, out of scope). A place-claim lives in
 * ~/.colab/state.json, keyed by absolute checkout PATH — not by repo, so a repo running several
 * worktrees needs one hold per checkout in use. Two machines each holding their own local lock on
 * what happens to be the same logical repo is a distributed-systems question this module does not
 * answer; the existing backstop (separate working trees, git's own push rejection on a stale ref)
 * remains what prevents two machines from landing the same conflict undetected. A record whose
 * `host` does not match this machine is proof `~/.colab` itself is being synced across machines,
 * which `syncedStateProblem` below treats as the same hazard as a synced lock file.
 *
 * NEVER IN A FILE-SYNCED LOCATION. A Resilio/Syncthing/Dropbox/iCloud path has no atomicity and no
 * consistency guarantee inside its sync window: two sessions can each read "unlocked", each write
 * "held by me", and both proceed WITH CONFIDENCE — worse than having no lock. `syncedStateProblem`
 * refuses an acquire from such a path; it is a heuristic (a marker scan), and the foreign-host
 * check in `isLive` is the behavioural backstop that fires even when the marker scan misses.
 *
 * DEGRADED MODE: SERIAL FALLS BACK TO ISOLATED, NEVER TO UNLOCKED. If the lock cannot be reached —
 * state unreadable, the lock directory stuck — callers are told to use a worktree and branch
 * instead, which needs no lock. Speed degrades; safety never does. THIS MODULE DOES NOT IMPLEMENT
 * THAT ITSELF — `state.loadState()`/`state.mutate()` are what can throw on an unreadable file or a
 * stuck lock, and `place.js` never calls either (every function here takes an already-loaded state
 * object). The catch lives in `tools/colab`'s `placeState()`/`placeMutate()` helpers, used by every
 * caller that acquires or checks a place-claim (`cmdSolo`, `cmdClaim`'s trunk-checkout path,
 * `cmdPlace`) — see those for the actual degrade behaviour, exit code 2 on `cmdPlace`.
